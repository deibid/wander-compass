# Wander Compass

A wearable that takes you to streets where you've never been before.

Wander Compass is made with love and 3 different components: a Web app, an Android app and a physical controller programmed with Arduino.

All of the code used to live in this repository, but I split each component into a different repository for better development and maintenance processes.

You can see the code for each components in the following links:

* [Web app](https://github.com/deibid/wander-compass-hardware)
* [Android app](https://github.com/deibid/wander-compass-android)
* [Arduino controller](https://github.com/deibid/wander-compass-hardware)
